    <body>
        My name is Ryan Burns. I am an ISchool student studying 
        Information Management Technology with a specialization in Data Analytics.
        I really enjoy coding. I Enjoy listening to and making music in my free time.
        My favorite movie is Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World because of the arcade-like style.
        I enjoy hanging out with friends and watching movies. I spend most of my time creating.
